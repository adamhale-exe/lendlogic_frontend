## Overview

Welcome to **LendLogic**, your all-in-one solution for personalized financial insights and decision-making related to mortgages. This application goes beyond the conventional one-size-fits-all approach, recognizing that users dealing with mortgage-related matters have unique needs that require specialized features and services.

## Problem Statement

A substantial portion of users engages with the app for mortgage-related reasons. However, current products on the market lack of differentiation for these users and fail to provide user-specific features. This generic approach may lead to under-serving the unique needs of customers dealing with mortgage-related matters. With the complexity and significance of mortgage decisions, there is a substantial opportunity to enhance the customer experience by offering features and services specifically tailored to these needs.

## Solution

## User Authentication and Data Storage

To enhance user experience, we implemented cookies to simulate login for our users. This approach allows us to store the user's email address locally, avoiding constant authentication. By associating user answers with their email, we can select appropriate tools for the user to see on the dashboard. This seamless integration with the backend ensures efficient data retrieval and tool customization.

## Preference Gathering Tool and Personalized Dashboard

This is a mechanism that actively engages users to collect data about their financial preferences, goals, and requirements. This data is then leveraged to create a personalized and dynamic user experience within the LendLogic app, enhancing its relevance and usefulness for individual users.

The gathered information is then utilized to select and display appropriate financial tools and features on the dashboard that align with the user's unique requirements. This tailored experience allows users to review personal data specific to them while accessing tools specific to their financial needs and goals. 

### Property Deposit Estimation for New Buyers and Suggested Monthly Savings

Users receive an immediate estimate of the required deposit for properties in their area. This clear, financial goal can be further explored by pressing the ‘Find out more’ button. This feature empowers users with crucial information for their property investment decisions and financial needs.

Users can see a suggested monthly saving and an automatically calculated timeframe based on this saving. A user-friendly slider allows users to adjust their monthly savings, providing immediate feedback on the length of time it will take to reach their deposit goal. This feature promotes financial planning and goal setting.

### Dynamic User Input Adjustment

We understand that property values may change. Therefore, we implemented a filter to allow users to input a different property value if they feel that the evaluation stored against their data is incorrect or out of date. This flexibility reflects on the time required to obtain the money for the deposit, positively or negatively impacting the user's financial timeline.

The user is also able to search for a specific post code and if that matches data stored on the databse, the value of the deposit required to buy a property is updated accordingly. 

## Remortgage Features

We have also implemented features for the remortgage side of the app, where the user is able to access and explore different deals based on their expectations and their current mortgage plans. There is a timeline to buy providing detailed information to the user.
